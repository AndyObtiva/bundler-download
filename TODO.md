# TODO

- `bundle download gem_name` processes Downloadfile for a specified gem only
- Designate some downloads as optional to avoid auto-installing upon `bundle install` (yet only with `bundle download --optional`)
- `bundle download clear` command to remove downloads (alias as `clean` too)
- Support `os` option for `download` DSL keyword in `Downloadfile`
